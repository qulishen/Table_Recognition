# Advanced Literate Machinery

## Introduction

The ultimate goal of our research is to build a system that has high-level intelligence, i.e., possessing the abilities to ***read, think and create***, so advanced that it could even surpass human intelligence one day in the future. We name this kind of systems **Advanced Literate Machinery (ALM)**.

To start with, we currently focus on teaching machines to ***read*** from images and documents. In years to come, we will explore the possibilities of endowing machines with the intellectual capabilities of ***thinking and creating***, catching up with and surpassing [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4).

This project is maintained by the **读光 OCR Team** (读光-Du Guang means “*Reading The Light*”) in the [Language Technology Lab, Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/language-technology).

## Recent Updates

**2023.4 Release**
  - [**GeoLayoutLM**](./DocumentUnderstanding/GeoLayoutLM/) (*GeoLayoutLM: Geometric Pre-training for Visual Information Extraction,* CVPR 2023. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10759)): We propose a multi-modal framework, named GeoLayoutLM, for Visual Information Extraction (VIE). In contrast to previous methods for document pre-training, which usually learn geometric representation in an implicit way, GeoLayoutLM **explicitly** models the geometric relations of entities in documents.

**2023.2 Release**
  - [**LORE-TSR**](./DocumentUnderstanding/LORE-TSR/) (*LORE: Logical Location Regression Network for Table Structure Recognition,* AAAI 2022. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03730)): We model Table Structure Recognition (TSR) as a logical location regression problem and propose a new algorithm called LORE, standing for LOgical location REgression network, which for the first time **combines logical location regression together with spatial location regression** of table cells.

**2022.9 Release**
  - [**MGP-STR**](./OCR/MGP-STR/) (*Multi-Granularity Prediction for Scene Text Recognition,* ECCV 2022. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03592)): Based on [ViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) and a tailored Adaptive Addressing and Aggregation module, we explore an implicit way for incorporating linguistic knowledge by introducing subword representations to facilitate **multi-granularity** prediction and fusion in scene text recognition.
  - [**LevOCR**](./OCR/LevOCR/) (*Levenshtein OCR,* ECCV 2022. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03594)): Inspired by [Levenshtein Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11006), we cast the problem of scene text recognition as an iterative sequence refinement process, which allows for **parallel decoding, dynamic length change and good interpretability**.
